# mazerunner
A web application to visualize working of BFS, DFS and A star with Manhattan and Euclidean distances algorithms-
In this project, I have created mazes and then used the search algorithms for solving them. While taking into account only the mazes which are solvable, I have also generated the statistics for each of the following algorithms: BFS, DFS, Euclidean A Star and Manhattan A Star.  
I have created a web application to show the visualization of how the path is found using each of the given algorithms.
